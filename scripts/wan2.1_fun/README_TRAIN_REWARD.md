# Wan2.1-Fun-Reward-LoRAs
## Introduction
We explore the Reward Backpropagation technique <sup>[1](#ref1) [2](#ref2)</sup> to optimized the generated videos by [Wan2.1-Fun](https://github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun) for better alignment with human preferences.
We provide the following pre-trained models (i.e. LoRAs) along with [the training script](https://github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun/blob/main/scripts/wan2.1_fun/train_reward_lora.py). You can use these LoRAs to enhance the corresponding base model as a plug-in or train your own reward LoRA.

For more details, please refer to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun).

## Quick Start
Set `lora_path` and `lora_weight`  in [examples/wan2.1_fun/predict_t2v.py](https://github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun/blob/main/examples/wan2.1_fun/predict_t2v.py).

## Limitations
1. We observe after training to a certain extent, the reward continues to increase, but the quality of the generated videos does not further improve. 
   The model trickly learns some shortcuts (by adding artifacts in the background, i.e., adversarial patches) to increase the reward.
2. Currently, there is still a lack of suitable preference models for video generation. Directly using image preference models cannot 
   evaluate preferences along the temporal dimension (such as dynamism and consistency). Further more, We find using image preference models leads to a decrease 
   in the dynamism of generated videos. Although this can be mitigated by computing the reward using only the first frame of the decoded video, the impact still persists.
